# US_Medical_Insurance
Project coded in Python to consolidate data science foundations concepts such as loops, functions, lists, dictionaries.

The input of this project consists in a .csv list of US medical insurance clients that are described by different parameters:
  -  age
  -  sex
  -  bmi
  -  children
  -  smoker
  -  region
  -  charges

The goal was to familiarize with an IDE enviroment and, to open the input file and to provide some insights on the data available to practice
the core concepts of Python language and data science. (For this reason no additional libraries are used such as Pandas)

The environment used was Jupyter Lab, the only python library used is "csv" to open the input file.
The project is divided into two .ipynb files:
  1. "us_medical_insurance_costs":
     It is the main file where the .csv is imported and where the first consideration are stated, before conducting the analysis.
     Then all the analysis are conducted step by step and commented.
     Eventually, a short "Summary" section summarizes all the findings.
  2. "01_functions":
     This file store the functions defined and then imported in the main file above. This allows to keep the code cleaner and more organized for further implementations.
