    "There is not much difference in age: parents have on average nearly 40 years, while non parents are slightly younger and are 38.<br>\n",
    "Analyzing the fact of having children, it can be observed that clients who are parents pay on average 12.8% more that clients without them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking the smokers, the majority of the clients, nearly 80%, do not smoke. Looking at the average cost for smokers, their insurance charges are 280 % more expensive that those who do not smoke. This means that smoking appears to be a primary key factor in the final cost, but it is important to notice that the sample of smoking users is smaller and can lead misleading conclusions.\n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to age group, all clients were divided in 10 years ranges, such as 18-29, 30-39, 40-49,..., to identify which one is most represented and how does their respective average insurance cost vary.\n",
